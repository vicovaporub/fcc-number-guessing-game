# Number Guessing Game

## This project uses Bash and SQL to build a simple guessing game and store the data from the games in a database. It's required to obtain the Relational Database certification from [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org/).

**The tasks were:**
- Create a `number_guess` database and configure it
- Create `number_guess.sh` and give it executable permissions
- The script should have a shebang at the top of the file that uses `#!/bin/bash`
- The script should randomly generate a number that users have to guess
- When the script is run it should prompt the user for a username with `Enter your username`, and take a username as input. The database should allow username that are 22 characters.
- If the username has been used before, it should print `Welcome back, <username>! You have played <games_played> games, and your best game took <best_game> guesses.`
